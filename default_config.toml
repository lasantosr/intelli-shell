# This file contains the default configuration settings for Intelli-Shell.
# It serves as both a demo of available options and a reference for customization.
#
# To customize your configuration, copy this file to your user configuration directory or create a new one:
# ~/.config/intelli-shell/config.toml (on Linux)
# ~/Library/Preferences/org.IntelliShell.Intelli-Shell/config.toml (on macOS)
# %APPDATA%\IntelliShell\Intelli-Shell\config\config.toml (on Windows)
# $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/intelli-shell/config.toml (if XDG_CONFIG_HOME is set)
#
# Any setting not present on the file will inherit the default value displayed here.

# --------------------------------------------------------------
#   General 
# --------------------------------------------------------------

# The default directory for application data, such as the stored commands database.
# If this value is left empty, the application will use the system's default data directory:
# - ~/.local/share/intelli-shell (on Linux/macOS, unless overridden by XDG_DATA_HOME)
# - ~/Library/Application Support/org.IntelliShell.Intelli-Shell (on macOS)
# - %APPDATA%\IntelliShell\Intelli-Shell\data (on Windows)
data_dir = ""

# Whether to check for updates on application startup
check_updates = true

# Determines the rendering mode for the Terminal User Interface (TUI).
# - If `true`, the TUI will appear directly below the shell prompt, integrating seamlessly
# - If `false`, the TUI will take over the entire terminal screen
inline = true

# --------------------------------------------------------------
#   Gist Integration
# --------------------------------------------------------------

# Configuration for the default gist to use when importing or exporting (if no other is explicitly set)
[gist]
# The id of the gist, you can get it from the url after the username
id = ""
# Token to authenticate the API call to GH when exporting
# GIST_TOKEN env variable will take precedence over the config value
token = ""

# --------------------------------------------------------------
#   Search Command 
# --------------------------------------------------------------

# Configuration for the search command
[search]
# The delay (in ms) to wait and accumulate type events before triggering the query
delay = 250
# Specifies the default search mode to be used when initiating a search.
# Possible values are:
# - "auto": An internal algorithm is used to best match common human search patterns
# - "fuzzy": Employs fuzzy matching to find commands that are similar to the input query
# - "regex": Treats the input query as a regular expression, allowing for complex pattern matching
# - "exact": The search will only return commands that precisely match the entire input query
# - "relaxed": Attempts to find the maximum number of potentially relevant commands using broader matching criteria
mode = "auto"
# Whether to search for user commands only by default when initiating a search (excluding tldr and workspace)
user_only = false

# --------------------------------------------------------------
#   Logs 
# --------------------------------------------------------------

# Configuration settings for application logging.
#
# If an `INTELLI_LOG` environment variable exists, it will override the filter and enable logging.
[logs]
# Whether application logging is enabled.
# If set to `true`, the application will write detailed logs to a file within the data directory.
enabled = false
# The log filter to apply, controlling which logs are recorded.
#
# This string supports the `tracing-subscriber`'s environment filter syntax, for example:
# - "info" enables info log level (and above: warn and error)
# - "warn,intelli_shell=debug" enables debug for `intelli_shell` and warn for the rest
filter = "info"

# --------------------------------------------------------------
#   Key Bindings
# --------------------------------------------------------------

# Configuration for the key bindings used to interact with the Terminal User Interface (TUI).
# Key bindings map an action within the application to one or more key press combinations.
#
# Each action can be bound to a single key event string or a list of key event strings.
# If a list is provided, pressing any of the listed combinations will trigger the action.
#
# Key event strings are parsed from a simple format:
# - Modifiers (optional, separated by `-` or `+`): `ctrl`, `shift`, `alt`
# - Followed by the key name or character
[keybindings]
# Exit the TUI gracefully
quit = "esc"
# Update the currently highlighted record or item (e.g., edit a command)
update = ["ctrl-u", "ctrl-e", "F2"]
# Delete the currently highlighted record or item
delete = "ctrl-d"
# Confirm a selection or action related to the highlighted record
confirm = ["tab", "enter"]
# Execute the action associated with the highlighted record or item (e.g., run a command)
execute = ["ctrl-enter", "ctrl-r"]
# Toggle the search mode
search_mode = "ctrl-s"
# Toggle whether to search for user commands only or include workspace and tldr's
search_user_only = "ctrl-o"

# --------------------------------------------------------------
#   Theme
# --------------------------------------------------------------

# Configuration for the visual theme of the Terminal User Interface (TUI).
#
# Styles are defined using a string that can consist of one or more optional modifiers
# followed by an optional color. Modifiers and colors should be space-separated.
#
# Supported Modifiers: `bold`, `dim`, `italic`, `underline`
#
# Supported Color Formats:
# - Keep the original terminal color (no ANSI escape codes): "default" or an empty string (`""`)
# - Named colors (standard ANSI): "black", "red", etc.
# - RGB color value: "rgb(15, 15, 15)"
# - Hexadecimal color value: "#112233"
# - ANSI 8-bit indexed color (integer string from 0 to 255): "8", "13", etc.
[theme]
# The primary style used for main elements, like selected items or important text
primary = "default"
# The secondary style used for less prominent elements, like unselected items
secondary = "dim"
# An accent style used to highlight specific elements, like aliases or keywords
accent = "yellow"
# The style used for comments or explanatory text
comment = "italic green"
# The style used for errors
error = "dark red"
# The background color for the highlighted item in a list. Use "none" for no background color
highlight = "dark gray"
# The string symbol displayed next to the highlighted item
highlight_symbol = "» "
# The primary style applied specifically to a highlighted item
highlight_primary = "default"
# The secondary style applied specifically to a highlighted item
highlight_secondary = "dim"
# The accent style applied specifically to a highlighted item
highlight_accent = "yellow"
# The comments style applied specifically to a highlighted item
highlight_comment = "italic green"

#   Search Tuning
# --------------------------------------------------------------

# Configuration to tune the variables suggestion ranking algorithm.
#
# The final score for a variable suggestion is a weighted sum of points from two sources:
# 1. Context Score: Other variable values already selected to the command
# 2. Path Score: Where the value has been used before
# The total usage will be used as a tie-breaker if the same points are scored
[tuning.variables]
# Total points assigned for matching contextual information (e.g., previous variables values)
context.points = 700

# Total points assigned for matching any usage on a relevant path
path.points = 300
# Weights applied to a variable path score based on where it was used
path.exact = 1.0
path.ancestor = 0.5
path.descendant = 0.25
path.unrelated = 0.1

# Configuration to tune the command search ranking algorithm.
#
# The final score for a command is a weighted sum of points from three sources:
# 1. Usage Score: How often the command has been globally used
# 2. Path Score: Where the command has been used before
# 3. Text Relevance: How well the command's text matches the search query (if any)
[tuning.commands]
# Total points assigned to the global usage of a command
usage.points = 100

# Total points assigned for matching any usage on a relevant path
path.points = 300
# Weights applied to a command path points based on where it was used
path.exact = 1.0
path.ancestor = 0.5
path.descendant = 0.25
path.unrelated = 0.1

# Total points assigned to the normalized text relevance score
text.points = 600
# The weight for the command's `cmd` field in the text search
text.command = 2.0
# The weight for the command's `description` field in the text search
text.description = 1.0

# --- "auto" Mode Specific Tuning ---
# Multiplier for high-confidence prefix matches
text.auto.prefix = 1.5
# Multiplier for standard "all words must match" fuzzy results
text.auto.fuzzy = 1.0
# Multiplier for lower-confidence "any word can match" relaxed results
text.auto.relaxed = 0.5
# A boost multiplier to add when the search term matches the start of a command
text.auto.root = 2.0
